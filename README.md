ArmA 3 Mod Launcher


Last Update: Beta 0.1.1.4

Updates -
 * Upgraded the user interface to match the USJFCOM website theme.
 * Added Settings - Allow user to look for Arma 3 Install path - If not set it will use the default install paths (Program Files\Steam\Steamapps\common\Arma 3) & (Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\common\Arma 3)
 * Updated the CheckListBox, Will now use the selected Arma 3 path instead of using the defult install paths
 * Launcher now saves some of users settings - Saves Arma 3 install path, saves close launcher check box ~`Going to add save settings for all controls`~
 * Updated the Launcher Logo and added new color system for Progress Bar
 
Issues -
 * AboutUs Form still has issues rendering.
 
 
 
 
 
 
About this application:
 This launcher was created for USJFCOM, a Mil-sim team that plays ArmA 3. This launcher allows the user to launch their    Arma 3 game with selected mods enabled or disabled. This is a better method than going into ArmA 3 and enabling them or   disabling them. This cuts down user time of turning on/off selected mods and more time of playing the game.
 
 This is a consept from a past application that I created called the TF13 Client - It does the same thing but differenlt   and it is old/out dated code. This application uses Microsoft's ClickOnce, it has a Security built into the code, plus    giving us a perfect way to publishing update versions of the launcher.
 
 We are also using Windows authentication application services. It also has Optimize code. The idea of this launcher is to  provide the user the comfort of having an application with their team's logo, have control of launching their game with or with out any mods enable plus allow the user to download updates for their team mods.
